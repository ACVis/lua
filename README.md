## Interesting Facts
   Lua can call functions written in Lua and functions written in C

   All lua library functions are written in C

   Functions are first class variables. A function is a value just like a string or number. It can be stored in a global or local variable, in a table, 
   it can be passed as an argument and returned by a function.

   Functions have lexical scoping. This means functions can access variables of its enclosing functions. This also means that lua contains lambda
   calculus.
